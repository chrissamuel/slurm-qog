# slurm-qog
Perl script to generate "quality-of-guess" feedback for users about their requested Slurm walltimes.

https://github.com/chrissamuel/slurm-qog

# Usage

```
$ ./qog --help
Usage: ./qog --help | --all --days [number-of-days] | --days [number-of-days] --user $USER --account $ACCOUNT
```

*You must have `sacct` in your $PATH of course!*

# Examples

For the root user it will summarise the QOG for the last 7 days of usage.

```
# ./qog 
WARNING: when run as root without options it defaults to --all
Capping look back to 7 days for --all

Over the last 7 days all jobs used 8,592 days 11:19:07 over 67,033 jobs
They requested a total time of 51,758 days 16:47:00

This equates to an overestimate of 6.0 times the actual usage
```

For a normal user it will default to summarising their last 30 days of usage.

```
$ ./qog

Over the last 30 days your jobs used 00:54:21 over 87 jobs
They requested a total time of 07:15:00

This equates to an overestimate of 8.0 times the actual usage

```

A user can summarise over less time than the default.

```
$ ./qog --days=5

Over the last 5 days your jobs used 00:05:08 over 4 jobs
They requested a total time of 00:20:00

This equates to an overestimate of 3.9 times the actual usage

```

You can also specify a Slurm account, if you are root.

```
# ./qog --account=hpcadmin

Over the last 30 days their jobs used 01:39:54 over 96 jobs
They requested a total time of 13:40:00

This equates to an overestimate of 8.2 times the actual usage

```
